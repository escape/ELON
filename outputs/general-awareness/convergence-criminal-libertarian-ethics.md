# Transactional Ethics in Darknet Crime vs. Algorithmic Populism: Convergence and Divergence

## Introduction  
Two seemingly disparate online realms —the criminal underworld of darknet marketplaces and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gangs, and the algorithm-driven far-right populist movements of contemporary politics —reveal a startling similarity. Both are governed by an **instrumental, transactional logic** that treats morals and rules as negotiable costs. In darknet circles, informal bans on attacking hospitals or distributing child-exploitation material exist not out of altruism, but to reduce legal heat and safeguard profits. Likewise, algorithmic far-right actors deploy **absolutist free-speech rhetoric** (e.g. “Let the people decide; any moderation is tyranny”) to delegitimise liberal-democratic constraints whenever such limits threaten their influence.

This essay defines each framework’s core claims and incentives, analyses five mechanisms of convergence, highlights three enduring divergences, and illustrates the argument with two recent case studies. It concludes by asking whether the dominance of transactional logic in both criminal and political spheres is genuinely novel or merely a digital rebranding of older anti-institutional discourses.

## 1. Instrumental Ethics in Darknet Marketplaces and Ransomware Communities  

Darknet markets and RaaS operations exhibit **utilitarian moral frameworks**. Their guiding principle might be summarised as *“Nothing personal, just business.”*  

* **Core claim.** Any ethical code is subordinate to operational resilience.  
* **Incentives.** Maximise revenue while minimising state retaliation.  
* **Boundary conditions.** Avoid actions (e.g. attacking hospitals, hosting child sexual-abuse images, targeting domestic networks) that provoke extraordinary law-enforcement attention.  

The original Silk Road (2011-2013) illustrates this pragmatism: it allowed drugs but forbade child pornography, weapons, and murder-for-hire because those categories were “heat magnets” that could jeopardise the enterprise.[^1] Modern ransomware gangs follow the same calculus. **LockBit** publicly forbids affiliates from hitting healthcare; when an affiliate nonetheless encrypted the SickKids children’s hospital (Toronto) in December 2022, LockBit apologised, released a free decryptor, and banned the culprit—explicitly to preserve its business reputation.[^2] During the **Colonial Pipeline** crisis (May 2021), the DarkSide gang likewise issued a contrite statement: “Our goal is to make money, not create problems for society; we will vet partners more carefully.”[^3]  

Threat-actors also embed geo-filters that stop their malware if the host system uses Russian or CIS-language settings, thereby avoiding local victims and, by extension, local police.[^4] Thus, the darknet “ethic” is a set of cost-benefit rules that *look* moral but are purely transactional risk controls.

## 2. Transactional Free-Speech Rhetoric in Algorithmic Far-Right Populism  

Far-right populists—especially U.S. “Trumpian” and EU fellow-traveller movements—employ **pragmatic free-expression absolutism**:

* **Core claim.** Any institutional gatekeeping (fact-checks, platform policies, academic expertise) is elitist oppression of “the people.”  
* **Incentives.** Maximise engagement, loyalty, and narrative dominance; delegitimise constraining institutions.  
* **Boundary conditions.** Few: if content mobilises supporters, its factuality or extremism is irrelevant; attempts to limit it prove a conspiracy.

When Twitter first labelled Donald Trump’s 2020 mail-in-ballot tweet as “potentially misleading,” Trump thundered that the platform was “**stifling FREE SPEECH**” and signed an executive order threatening its Section 230 protections.[^5] The same motif recurred after the 2020 U.S. election: widespread falsehoods about a “stolen” vote were framed as merely “letting Americans decide” whom to trust—while court rulings, journalists, and social-media rules were portrayed as tyrannical censorship.[^6] An identical logic surfaced in Europe during debates over the EU’s Digital Services Act: far-right MEPs decried hate-speech takedowns as an EU “Big Brother” plot, regardless of the content’s incitement potential.[^7]  

Hence, algorithmic populism treats truth as optional and popularity as self-legitimating: *if millions share a claim, institutional filters are undemocratic.*

## 3. Five Mechanisms of Convergence  

| # | Converging Mechanism | How Transactional Logic Aligns the Domains |
|---|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Anti-institutional incentives** | Both prosper when trust in formal authority erodes. RaaS gangs exploit weak cyber-hygiene; populists attack courts, media, and multilateral bodies as corrupt. |
| **2** | **Alternative infrastructures** | Darknet sites (Tor, crypto) and alt-tech platforms (Gab, Telegram) bypass mainstream oversight, letting actors define their own rules. |
| **3** | **Engagement & profit algorithms** | Ransomware maximises ROI; outrage content maximises clicks. Sensational tactics (data-leak “shaming” sites, conspiratorial memes) are rewarded. |
| **4** | **In-group reputation systems** | Darknet forums use escrow and rating scores; far-right communities use loyalty policing. Violators of group norms are expelled to protect cohesion. |
| **5** | **Geopolitical symbiosis** | Russian tolerance of local cybercriminals and amplification of Western populist narratives illustrates how both weaken liberal rivals while staying deniable. |

## 4. Three Enduring Differences  

1. **Legality & Visibility.** Cybercrime must remain clandestine; populists seek electoral legitimacy and media spectacle.  
2. **Ultimate Goals.** RaaS: profit. Populists: ideological power (though grift often accompanies).  
3. **Attitude to Physical Harm.** Many ransomware crews eschew life-threatening targets (bad for business). Populist rhetoric can *encourage* or excuse violence if it serves “the people’s will” (e.g. 6 Jan 2021).

## 5. Case Studies  

### 5.1 LockBit’s SickKids “Apology”  
* **Event.** December 2022 ransom attack on Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto).  
* **Response.** LockBit operators apologised on 1 Jan 2023, supplied a free decryptor, and banned the affiliate.[^2]  
* **Rationale.** Uphold the gang’s “no-healthcare” rule to avert a multi-jurisdictional manhunt and protect its profitability.  

### 5.2 Trump’s 2020 Election Disinformation  
* **Event.** Between 3 Nov 2020 and 6 Jan 2021, Donald Trump tweeted >400 times alleging systemic fraud; platforms added warnings.[^6]  
* **Response.** Trump denounced moderation as censorship, threatened regulation, and urged supporters to “stop the steal.”  
* **Outcome.** Belief in a rigged election reached 60-70 % among GOP voters; a mass mobilisation culminated in the Capitol riot. Truth was expendable so long as the narrative retained political utility.

## 6. Conclusion  

The convergence of darknet instrumental “ethics” and algorithmic populist free-speech absolutism rests on a shared **transactional worldview**: rules are negotiable instruments, valuable only insofar as they advance profit or power. Historically, criminals have observed pragmatic codes and demagogues have attacked gatekeepers—thus the mindset is not new. Yet the **digital affordances of the 2020s** (borderless ransomware, algorithmic virality, alt-tech echo-chambers) amplify and interlink these phenomena at unprecedented speed and scale. Whether liberal societies can restore non-transactional norms—grounded in consistent ethics and factual accuracy—now depends on reinforcing institutional resilience without inadvertently feeding the anti-institutional narrative these actors so profitably exploit.
